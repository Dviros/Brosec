  - Some minor changes to the ```bros encode`` module. The input field can be opened in the default text editor (Mac/Linux only) via C-e. In order to implement this, the other keyboard shortcuts had to be changed.

## 1.2.1 _(September 10, 2016)_

- Enhancement
  - bros http uploader is disabled by default. It is now enabled via the --upload option. Ex: ```bros http --upload```

    - Added a simple file upload at /upload
    - Added a basic auth support via ```bros http(s) --username=foo --password=bar

  - Fixed an issue that would cause Brosec to prematurely exit when a payload with a menu option value greater than 9 was requested from the command line. For example, the <code>bros 3</code>  > <code>1</code> > <code>11</code>  payload (Windows payload to search the registry for a specific value) would exit prematurely if <code>bros 3111</code> was entered from the command line.
  - Minor fixes to a few Windows payloads that were using a deprecated Brosec syntax

## 1.1.5 _(August 4, 2016)_
- Features
  - Brosec variable values will be copied to the clipboard when retrieved. For example, running ```bros lhost``` from the command line will retrieve the LHOST variable, and copy it to your clipboard.

  - Removed the ```Output copied to clipboard!``` message to reduce clutter.
